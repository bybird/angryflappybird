# AngryFlappyBird
Team Bybird: Marina, Cindy, Jonny

In the AngryFlappyBird game, the player uses the GUI button to move the angry flappy bird in a scrolling scene.
In the scene, a set of two pipes of a random height show up after every fixed amount of time, some upward facing pipes have collectable eggs on top of them, while some downward facing pipes have pig thieves dropping down to steal the eggs.
The goal of the game is for the angry flappy bird to move through the pipes without collision while collecting as many eggs as possible along the way to prevent the pigs from stealing the eggs.

### Bird
- [x] A player uses the button to control the birdâ€™s flight
- [x] Collects eggs
Pipe
- [x] Appears in pairs every fixed amount of time
- [x] One life is taken from the bird when a collision with any pipe occurs
- [ ] The bird bounces backward and drops immediately upon collision
### Egg
- [x] Appears
- [x] Randomly on the upward facing pipes Could be collected either by the pig or the bird
- [x] If a pig collects an egg, points were lost
- [x] If the bird collects an egg, different events will be triggered depending on the color of the egg
- [x] If a white egg is collected, points will be added
- [x] If a golden egg is collected, 6 seconds of autopilot mode will be triggered.
### Pig (thief in our game)
- [x] Drops
- [x] Randomly from downward facing pipes
- [x] Could collect the egg right beneath it and lead to points lost if the egg is not collected by the bird first
- [x] The game is over and score is reset to 0 if the bird collides with a pig
### Floor
- [x] Scrolls through the scene consistently during the game until a collision happens.
- [x] The game is over and the score is reset to 0 if the bird collides with the floor.
- [x] The bird stops moving immediately upon collision.
### Background
- [x] Changes from night to day periodically.
### UI panel
- [x] A button that controls the start of the game and the wing flap of the bird.
- [x] A selector for the user to choose the difficulty levels. (minimum of 3 levels)
- [x] An icon with text description of the white egg, golden egg and the pigs is required.
### Keep score and lives
- [x] Show score and lives text
- [x] Keep score and lives accumulative
# 
- Cindy: The algorithm to make the eggs and pigs randomly appears on the pipe with different heights.
- Marina: Implementing autopilot mode; changing the background day to night periodically; timeline.
- Jonny: Implementing UI panel and code to make changes to text label for lives and score; Working on GitHub.
# 
The most challenging part about the project
- Merging the code
- The bouncing back effect after the collision.
